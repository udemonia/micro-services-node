# Skaffold

CLI to update code within a running pod; without Skaffold you need to

<https://skaffold.dev/>

- ensure the deployment is using the 'latest' tag in the pod spec

- make an update to the code

- build the image

- push the image to docker hub

- run the command `kubectl rollout restart deployment [depl name]`

## Note on Env

We will only be using this with dev

## Benefits

change clusters super easily, auto updates

### If you don't see a change after a hot save

```txt
If you did not see your server restart after changing the index.ts file, do the following:

Open the package.json file in the â€˜authâ€™ directory

Find the â€˜startâ€™ script

Update the start script to the following:

ts-node-dev --poll src/index.ts
```
